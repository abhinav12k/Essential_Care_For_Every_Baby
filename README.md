## UI Implementation
- I have used constraint layout so that the view are perfect for every screen size.
- Navigation graph and NavHostFragment to change the fragments
- Segregated constants, dummy data used in project
- Added styles to be used globally to minimize code redundancy 
- Generic names for resource values and views
- Setup views of recycler view with the dummy data
- Organized the project with a specific folder structure
- Used vector drawables wherever possible
- Setup Bottom Nav Bar with Navigation components
